# RUMANCLASS (RUminal microbiome MANually CLASSifier)

## QIIME2 manually weighted classifier for species-specific ruminal e micribome analysis

This method was developed to provide enhanced resolution for ruminant microbiome analysis. It is an advanced version of the approach proposed by Kaehler et al. (2019). The method utilizes open-source sequences available from the NCBI BioProject respiratory database and employs preprocessing steps alongside the QIIME2 default workflow.

For detailed instructions, please refer to the **[Tutorial](https://github.com/6seok/rumanclass/blob/main/Tutorial.md#tutorial)**.

As of January 2025, a species-specific weighted classifier for Hanwoo cattle has been created. 
Future plans include developing classifiers for Holstein, Jersey, Charolais, and Aberdeen Angus breeds.
